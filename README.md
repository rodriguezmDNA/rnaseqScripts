###Pipeline for Analysis of RNASeq data


For a quick intro on RNASeq data analysis see [this notebook](A_Quick_Intro_RNASeq.ipynb)

The ([pipeline tutorial](Pipeline.ipynb)) contains a (semi) quick intro on how to use the scripts in the **Scripts** folder.

This new version allows for a more user friendly (or rather, less user unfriendly) interface. The bash scripts can be run with arguments which make them easier (?) to run.

The 'Old' folder contains the previous version of the same scripts. These had to be modified manually before running them. 

Feedback is appreciated!
